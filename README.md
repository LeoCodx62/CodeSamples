# CodeSamples
Code sample from a university project consisting of a simulation of a robot picking up 3 different objects from a table and place them on another table. 

We coded the robot movements to the different places, the object detection and the pick/place routine.
In the folder there is a video shwoing the task and a brief report about the project.

The code can be found in the src folder navigation_client/server and the three nodes.
